## Scan Implementation Progress for Burn GPU Backend

This document describes the addition of parallel scan operations to the Burn deep learning framework, specifically targeting the WGPU/CubeCL backend for GPU acceleration.

## Background

Scan operations (also known as prefix operations) are fundamental building blocks in parallel computing and linear algebra. Common scan operations include cumulative sum (cumsum), cumulative product (cumprod), cumulative maximum (cummax), and cumulative minimum (cummin).

While Burn already had scan implementations, the WGPU/CubeCL backend was using a serial fallback approach. This implementation adds proper parallel scan algorithms to leverage GPU compute power effectively.

## Implementation Details

### File Location
- Primary implementation: `crates/burn-cubecl/src/kernel/scan.rs`

### Algorithm Choice
The implementation uses the Hillis-Steele parallel scan algorithm:
- Work-inefficient but simple to implement
- O(log n) depth complexity
- Well-suited for GPU workgroup-level parallelism
- Uses shared memory for efficient communication between threads

### Key Components

#### 1. Smart Algorithm Selection
The implementation automatically chooses between serial and parallel algorithms based on array size:
- Arrays â‰¤ 256 elements: Uses existing serial implementation (more efficient for small arrays)
- Arrays > 256 elements: Uses parallel Hillis-Steele algorithm

#### 2. Parallel Scan Kernel
```rust
fn scan_parallel_kernel_f32<F: Float>(
    input: &Tensor<F>,
    output: &mut Tensor<F>,
    dim: u32,
    operation: u32,
)
```

Features:
- Separate kernels for f32 and f64 precision
- Handles different scan operations (Add, Mul, Max, Min)
- Multi-pass support for arrays larger than workgroup size
- Proper identity value handling for each operation type

#### 3. Workgroup-Level Implementation
```rust
fn hillis_steele_scan_f32<F: Float>(
    local_data: &mut SharedMemory<F>,
    local_id: u32,
    n: u32,
    operation: u32,
)
```

- Uses shared memory for thread communication
- Implements standard Hillis-Steele up-sweep pattern
- Synchronization barriers between iterations
- Type-safe operations with proper CubeCL integration

### Configuration Constants
- `SERIAL_THRESHOLD`: 256 elements (threshold for algorithm selection)
- `WORKGROUP_SIZE`: 256 threads per workgroup
- `ELEMENTS_PER_THREAD`: 4 (for multi-pass scenarios)

## Technical Challenges Addressed

### 1. CubeCL Type System Integration
The implementation properly handles CubeCL's type system requirements:
- Uses `F::new()` for type conversion instead of direct casting
- Separate implementations for f32 and f64 to avoid type complexity
- Proper `ExpandElementTyped` trait usage

### 2. Operation Polymorphism
Handles different scan operations through runtime dispatch:
- Operation encoding: Add(0), Mul(1), Max(2), Min(3)
- Correct identity values for each operation
- Type-appropriate comparisons for Min/Max operations

### 3. Memory Management
- Efficient shared memory usage within workgroups
- Proper synchronization with `sync_cube()`
- Safe bounds checking for array access

## Backend Comparison

### WGPU/CubeCL Backend (This Implementation)
- Algorithm selection based on array size
- Parallel Hillis-Steele for large arrays
- Serial fallback for small arrays
- GPU-optimized with shared memory

### NdArray Backend (Existing)
- Direct delegation to `ndarray::accumulate_axis_inplace()`
- No algorithm selection needed
- CPU-optimized by underlying library
- Simpler implementation due to CPU architecture

## Performance Characteristics

### Parallel Algorithm
- Time complexity: O(log n) depth, O(n log n) work
- Space complexity: O(n) shared memory per workgroup
- Optimal for: Large arrays on GPU hardware
- Theoretical speedup: Significant for arrays > 1000 elements

### Serial Fallback
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(1) additional
- Optimal for: Small arrays where launch overhead dominates

## Testing

Test coverage includes:
- Basic functionality for all operation types
- Multi-dimensional tensor operations
- Edge cases (empty arrays, single elements)
- Analytical test cases with known expected results
- Performance validation for algorithm selection threshold

## Future Considerations

1. **Algorithm Extensions**: Could implement more work-efficient algorithms like Blelloch scan for very large arrays
2. **Optimization**: Fine-tune the serial/parallel threshold based on empirical performance data
3. **Multi-GPU**: Extend for distributed scan operations across multiple GPUs
4. **Precision**: Add support for other numeric types beyond f32/f64

## Integration Notes

The implementation is fully integrated with Burn's existing tensor API:
- No breaking changes to public interfaces
- Backward compatible with existing code
- Automatically used when appropriate hardware is available
- Falls back gracefully on unsupported platforms

## Code Quality

- Comprehensive documentation for all public functions
- Type safety through Rust's ownership system
- Error handling for edge cases
- Follow Burn's existing code style and patterns
